              Basic Needs Security refers to the food, housing, and wellness
              security of our community. We understand that basic needs have a
              direct impact on the wellness, mental-emotional-physical health,
              academic performance, professional development, and holistic
              success of our students. UC Berkeley's Basic Needs Security
              Committee is fully dedicated to leading the transformation of UC
              Berkeley into a basic needs secure institution of higher
              education.

                  CalFresh improved the quality of my college life tremendously.
                  Once I received my EBT card, I stopped having to worry about
                  how Iâ€™d afford my next meal, and could instead focus on how I
                  would ace my next midterm. No university student should have
                  to prioritize food or shelter above their education, and
                  CalFresh is making this a reality for many students. CalFresh
                  has mitigated my stress tenfold and I am eternally grateful. -

                  I was struggling to make ends meet during the last month of
                  spring semester and suffered from food insecurity everyday. I
                  had no idea when my next meal was going to be and I was too
                  afraid to ask for help. After some guidance from my EOP
                  counselor, I was connected to the Financial Aid Scholarships
                  and Food Assistance Program. Within one day of emailing them,
                  I was supplied with additional funds to my student account.
                  Without this program, I would have continued to suffer in
                  silence. This program is crucial to students coming from
                  low-income homes and I'm grateful for the assistance I was
                  provided in my time of need. - Anonymous, Class of 2019

                  How many times have you heard the phrase, "I can't afford to
                  eat healthily?" In addition to interacting with my peers,
                  crafting scrumptious recipes, and having a good time, I was
                  also able to walk away with a new outlook on cooking and
                  nutrition. I no longer associate nutritionally adequate foods
                  with being expensive, monotonous and inaccessible. This class
                  has taught me how to utilize ingredients more effectively and
                  creatively--often resulting in unique and tasty flavor
                  profiles. - Kevin Soun, Fall 2017
