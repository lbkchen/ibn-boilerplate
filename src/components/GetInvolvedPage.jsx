                    Being
                    a first generation, low-income student, I constantly face economic challenges and the Food
                    Pantry
                    is a
                    great resource that helps alleviate student food need. Food insecurity is a serious issue
                    and
                    it is
                    critical for our students to have nutritious foods so that they can concentrate on their
                    academics.”
